# Brain Model Setup Instructions

Since the Brain Model 3D file (`brain.glb`) is missing from the project, you have a few options to resolve this issue:

## Option 1: Use a free 3D brain model

1. Download a free 3D brain model from websites like:
   - Sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/brain-97e50682c5f54abb8f3e46687c04a75c
   - TurboSquid: https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/free-obj-mode-brain/700292
   - CGTrader: https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/science-medical/medical/brain-anatomy

2. Convert the model to GLB format using Blender or online converters
3. Rename the file to `brain.glb` and place it in the `/public/models/` directory

## Option 2: Generate a brain model with AI tools

1. Use tools like:
   - Luma AI: https://lumalabs.ai/
   - Leonardo.AI: https://leonardo.ai/
   - Midjourney 3D

2. Request a 3D brain model
3. Download, convert to GLB if needed, and place in `/public/models/`

## Option 3: Use the fallback implementation

The current implementation has been updated to display a fallback brain model created with primitive shapes when the GLB file isn't available.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the 3D rendering:

1. Make sure the model file is in the correct location
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. If using a downloaded model, ensure it has proper materials and geometry
4. Consider optimizing large models to improve performance

The component has been updated to handle missing model files gracefully, so you should no longer see the white screen crash.
